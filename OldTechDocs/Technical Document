Version: 1.0
Author: [Your Name]
Date: [Today's Date]

1. 📌 Overview
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the technical architecture and implementation plan for a web application that allows users to anonymously share secrets or personal thoughts in a post format.

1.2 Goals
Provide a safe, anonymous platform for expression

Ensure posts cannot be traced to users

Moderate harmful or offensive content

Scalable, maintainable, and secure backend with anti-bot/anti-spam.

2. 🧱 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Backend	Go (Golang)
Frontend	React / Svelte / Vue (TBD)
Database	PostgreSQL
Hosting	Render / Railway / Fly.io / Docker on VPS
ORM	GORM (for Go)
API Format	REST / JSON
Auth (Optional)	None / Magic Links (optional future)
Moderation	AI-assisted / Admin Panel
Deployment	GitHub Actions + Docker

5. 🧩 Data Model
5.1 Post Table
Column	Type	Description
id	UUID (PK)	Unique identifier
content	TEXT	The secret / confession
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Time of submission
ip_hash	VARCHAR(64)	Hash of IP (for spam prevention)
flagged	BOOLEAN	For moderation (default false)

⚠️ No usernames, emails, or session data are stored to ensure anonymity. IPs can be hashed with salt for abuse control.

6. 🧾 API Endpoints
6.1 POST /api/posts
Description: Submit a secret anonymously
Request:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title":   "Homeless cat"
  "content": "I always secretly feed the homeless cats in my area, even though it is illegal and against the rules here."
}
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}
6.2 GET /api/posts
Description: List recent public posts
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "content": "...",
    "created_at": "timestamp"
  }
]
6.3 POST /api/posts/{id}/flag
Description: Mark a post as inappropriate

7. 🔒 Security & Privacy
No user accounts: True anonymity

Rate limiting: Based on hashed IP or external services (e.g. Cloudflare)

Profanity filter: Optional service (e.g. OpenAI moderation, Perspective API)

Content policy: Include disclaimers for user content

IP hashing: SHA-256 with salt, rotate salt periodically

8. 🛠️ Frontend Considerations
SPA using React or SvelteKit

Anonymous post form

List of secrets with timestamps

Optional dark/light theme

Minimalistic UI with no login or tracking

9. 🧪 Testing
Unit Tests: Core logic (services, handlers)

Integration Tests: End-to-end API behavior

Load Testing: Optional via k6 or Artillery

10. 🚀 Deployment
Build: Go binary + compiled frontend

Docker: Multi-stage build

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Database: Managed Postgres (e.g. Supabase, Railway)

Infra as Code: Optional (Terraform or Docker Compose)

11. 📈 Future Enhancements
AI-based content moderation

Category tags (e.g. Confession, Funny, Advice)

Upvotes / Comments (with caution to avoid de-anonymization)

Mobile app wrapper (e.g. React Native or Capacitor)
